# Assignment 0

The purpose of this assignment is to make sure you are on GitHub, have access to the assignments repository for the course, to provide a very light introduction to developing visualizations for the web, and to fill out an informal survey.

Now, the fact that you are reading this suggests that you are on GitHub and have access to assignments. Yay!

Next, we will walk through how we will develop visualization applications for the web.

* First, it is necessary to run a local server on your computer, so that you may safely access local files when developing. The simplest way to do this is using python. Installing python on your machine should be fairly standard, depending on your preferred OS, so I will not go over this.
* Next, lets run a local server. Fire up a terminal, and go to the top-level directory of the assignments repository, it should be named **vis-fall2018-assignments**. If you renamed it when you cloned the repository, use that name. If you are running python2.x, then issue: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` to the terminal. If you are running python3.x, then issue: `python -m http.server`. You will now be running a local server on your machine.
* Fire up your **Google Chrome** browser. Go to the following url: [http://localhost:8000/assignment1](http://localhost:8000/assignment1). You should now see the survey that you will need to fill out. Hurrah!
* Open up `index.html` with your favorite text editor or IDE, and you will see a set of `question` and `answer` variables. Please fill in the `answer` variables with your responses.
* Refresh the webpage, and you will see your responses, with some d3 flair. To prove that you actually did this, please take a screenshot of your browser, and save the image to the `assignment0` directory.
* Zip up the `assignment0` directory, and submit it to Brightspace.
